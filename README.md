# Simple Coding Test for AIA Nodejs Fullstack Engineer

### What will you do, in general?

1. Create a simple frontend that can read API from backend and display it to user. Note the details when you create the FE.
2. Create a simple backend that can read external API feed and serve it to frontend when called.
3. Create unit testing for each of your app so it will survive changes.
4. Deploy your application on a simple stack that's available to the public, like EC2 instance, your private server, or local kubernetes.

### What we are expecting?

1. Good code understanding and expertise on using efficient method to solve problems.
2. Good source control usage (using Git!)
3. Practical use of tools available to you.

### What stack should you use?

1. For backend, we expect you to use nodejs or expressjs that supports RESTful API. 
2. For frontend, we expect you to use ReactJS. Use whatever framework you are comfortable with **within ReactJS Scope**, or don't use any at all (use ReactJS vanilla without CRA, for example). 
   It's all depend on your preferences, really!
3. Use any type of unit testing you are comfortable with.
4. Use Material-UI or Bootstrap to enhance the display of the app.

### Details, details.

1. Get the everchanging public image list from [Flickr public feed](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne). 
   You can check the documentation from this [API Doc](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/). Do note : Please use Flickr API, don't import Flickr module. You need to be able      to use the API Directly from Flickr, and **you need to be able to use / change the output properly. Be it XML or JSON, it's there on the API Documentation.** Another thing,      **please connect to Flickr on Backend side**, don't connect it directly from Frontend side. You need to create your own API on Backend side to be consumed by Frontend you create.
2. Use a public github repository to put your code. If you don't have one, just make one! Also, make use of good source versioning. 
   Commit often, and commit meaningfully.
3. Bonus point if you can implement tag searching on the image. Just a simple search box with OK button will do! 
4. Another bonus point if you automatically load the image list one at a time, and implement paging.
5. Deployment is optional. If you can't deploy your code, it's okay! Just make sure that you can demo it to us when we do the interview.

### So, what should you do?

## Use your creativity, and be unique. Do what you can do on this test! Don't worry if it's not perfect, we learn along the way!
